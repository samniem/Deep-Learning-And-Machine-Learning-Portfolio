# Deep-Learning-And-Machine-Learning-Portfolio
This contains a listing of machine learning and deep learning projects I have done over the years for ease of access

## [Random Forest Land Classification](https://github.com/samniem/Random-Forest-Land-Classification)
This project takes data from ESA Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites. The data is processed according to best practices provided by ESA using SNAP software at the time of implementing the project. 

## [Urban Area Classification Convolutional Autoencoder](https://github.com/samniem/urban-area-classification-conv-autoencoder)
This project attempted to predict land type over China using a convolutional autoencoder. The accuracy of the autoencoder was not good and the final resolution as to why the accuracy was not satisfactory remains unresolved. The article produced for this work can be accessed from this [Github link](https://github.com/samniem/Deep-Learning-And-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Urban_Area_Classification_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network.pdf).

## [Neural Network MLP Music Classification](https://github.com/samniem/Neural-Network-MLP-Music-Classification)
Classifying music genres using deep learning multilayer perceptron. Also performed principal component analysis on the music genre data before feeding it into the algorithm.


## [Adaline with Gradient Descent](https://github.com/samniem/Adaline)
One of the earliest and simplest neural networks. The adaline has been implemented using gradient descent. Cost function beahvior is tested for different learning rates for normalized and non-normalized data.
